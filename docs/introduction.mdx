title: Introduction to Undying Terminal
description: Persistent SSH sessions on Windows that survive network interruptions
---

## Welcome to Undying Terminal

Undying Terminal is a **Windows-native persistent terminal solution** that keeps your SSH sessions alive through network disconnects, VPN switches, laptop sleep, and other interruptions that would normally kill your terminal session.

## The Problem We Solve

Traditional SSH sessions are fragile. They break when:

- Your network connection drops
- Your laptop goes to sleep
- You switch VPN connections
- You change WiFi networks
- Your connection times out

**Result**: Lost work, interrupted processes, and frustration.

## The Undying Terminal Solution

Undying Terminal implements a **client-server-terminal architecture** with:

</CardGroup>

## Key Features

### Persistent Sessions
Your terminal stays alive even when:
- Network disconnects occur
- Laptop sleeps/wakes
- VPN switches happen
- WiFi changes

### Port Forwarding
<CodeGroup>
```powershell Forward Tunnels
# Local 8080 → Remote 9090
./undying-terminal.exe --connect 127.0.0.1 2022 <id> -t 8080:9090
```

```powershell Reverse Tunnels
# Server listens on 3000, client connects to local service
./undying-terminal.exe --connect 127.0.0.1 2022 <id> -r 3000:localhost:8000
```
</CodeGroup>

### Jumphost Support
Connect through intermediate jump servers:

    style D fill:#3e4954,color:#fff
```

### Keepalive & Recovery
- Automatic heartbeat packets (default 5s)
- Detects dead connections (3 missed → reconnect)
- Sequence-based recovery (resends missed packets)

## Architecture

Undying Terminal consists of three components:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Server">
    **undying-terminal-server.exe**
    
    Central session manager listening on TCP (default port 2022). Maintains client registry and handles authentication.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Terminal">
    **undying-terminal-terminal.exe**
    
    ConPTY-based terminal that spawns shell processes and connects to the server via named pipe.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Client">
    **undying-terminal.exe**
    
    User-facing client that handles I/O, reconnection, tunnels, and SSH bootstrap.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Use Cases

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Remote Development" icon="code">
    Keep long-running build processes alive even when your network drops. Perfect for remote development workflows where interruptions are costly.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="System Administration" icon="server">
    Maintain persistent connections to remote servers during system updates, backups, or maintenance tasks that take hours.
  </Accordion>
