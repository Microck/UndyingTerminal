## Before you start

- Search existing issues for duplicates.
- For bugs, capture the smallest reproducible case.

## Report a bug

Include:

- Your OS version
- The exact command you ran
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Logs (redact secrets)

## Propose a change

Open an issue describing:

- The user problem
- Your proposed solution
- Any compatibility or migration concerns

## Submit a pull request

General expectations:

- Keep changes focused and easy to review
- Add docs and tests when behavior changes
- Avoid formatting-only diffs unless requested
