## Goal

Running Undying Terminal as a Windows service is useful when you want:

- Sessions to survive user logoff
- The server to start automatically on boot
- A consistent runtime environment

## Install

This project supports service installation, but the exact command and flags depend on your distribution method (MSI, winget, chocolatey, or a zipped binary).

If your build includes a service subcommand, it typically follows this pattern:

```powershell
undyingterminal service install
undyingterminal service start
```

## Verify

```powershell
Get-Service | Where-Object { $_.Name -like "*undying*" }
```

## Uninstall

```powershell
undyingterminal service stop
undyingterminal service uninstall
```

## Troubleshooting

- If the service starts but sessions fail to reconnect after sleep/wake, confirm firewall rules and the configured bind address.
- If you run on a locked-down machine, ensure the service account has the required filesystem and network permissions.
